# MvmtTracker

## Project Description
A web app that enables users to log their weekly active minutes and compare their progress with others on the leaderboard. Users without an account can only view the leaderboard.

## To Run Locally

(Note: The redirect url for account creation will not redirect the user to localhost unless the redirect URL is changed. See the docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email))
